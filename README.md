# Jack Compiler
This is a compiler for the Jack programming language, written in Python. It translates Jack code to VM assembly code, which can then be run on the Hack computer simulator.

# Getting Started
To use the compiler, simply run the following command:
```
python JackCompiler.py path_to_input_file
```

For example, to compile the file `my_program.jack`, you would run the following command:

```
python compile.py my_program.jack
```
The compiler will output the VM assembly code to a file called my_program.vm.

## Features
The compiler supports the following features of the Jack language:

* Objects
* Methods
* Variables
* Expressions
* Statements
* Control flow
## Usage
The compiler is designed to be used as part of the Nand to Tetris course. However, it can also be used to compile Jack code for any other purpose.
